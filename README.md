[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/7f66136d-7f70-40b7-a3eb-c1ebf9478915/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/kynet-app/deploys)

Kynet is an advertisement platform that allows users to buy, sell, and exchange goods and services in a safe and efficient manner. Similar to other popular advertisement platforms like Bikroy, Kynet aims to connect buyers and sellers in a streamlined and user-friendly way.

Kynet provides a range of features that make it easy to post and search for ads. Users can create an account, post ads with images and descriptions, and browse listings by category, location, and price. 

Kynet is built using the latest web technologies, including React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend.
